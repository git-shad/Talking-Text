##### setup: follow the setup :)

-- download the file using this command also I expected that you had installed the `git bush` in your windows because the programming language I've used is c#. 

-- Open any terminal in Windows commonly is `cmd`, in `cmd` type `git clone https://github.com/git-shad/Talking-Text.git` in the `Talking Text` folder find the  `build.bat` and double click the `build.bat` to build the program in the bin folder.
